<h3>The show "Poftiți pe la noi: Poftiți la Nea Mărin"</h3>
<p>
I love this talk show because there are envolved people know as celebrities in activities from the<br/>
coutry in order to promote the country of Romania. Nea Marin is an action people.
</p>
<h3>Knife chefs</h3>
<p>
What I like abous this talk show is that I can learn to cook food just like at a restaurant.<br />
From here I can learn teamwork tricks and in the same time gives a state of relaxation and fun.

<h3>Yıldız De Bana</h3>
<p>
    From this series I learned not to let myself be humiliated by people and to trust myself,<br /> to know how to impose myself.
